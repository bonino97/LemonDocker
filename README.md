## Installation

### Quick Installation using build.sh

We have provided a `build.sh` script located within the `install` directory of the repository. This script automates the entire installation process, including updating the system, installing dependencies, building the Docker image, and running the container.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Connect to the Droplet**

   From your local terminal, connect to your Droplet using SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh root@<DROPLET_IP>
   ```

   Replace `<DROPLET_IP>` with the public IP address of your Droplet.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   On your Droplet, clone the LemonDocker repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bonino97/LemonDocker.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Install Directory**

   ```bash
   cd LemonDocker/install
   ```

4. **Give Execution Permissions to build.sh**

   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```

5. **Run build.sh**

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   The `build.sh` script will perform the following actions:

   - Update the system packages.
   - Install Git and Docker.
   - Build the Docker image.
   - Run the Docker container.

6. **Verify the Container is Running**

   Check that the container is running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND             CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
   <CONTAINER_ID> lemonbooster   "/entrypoint.sh"    xx minutes ago   Up xx minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   lemonbooster
   ```

---

### Manual Installation

For users who prefer to install everything manually, follow these steps.

#### **1. Connect to the Droplet**

From your local terminal, connect to your Droplet using SSH:

```bash
ssh root@<DROPLET_IP>
```

Replace `<DROPLET_IP>` with the public IP address of your Droplet.

#### **2. Update the System and Install Dependencies**

Update system packages and install Git and Docker:

```bash
# Update the system
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Git
apt-get install -y git

# Install Docker
apt-get install -y docker.io

# Start and enable Docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
```

#### **3. Clone the Repository**

Clone the LemonDocker repository on your Droplet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bonino97/LemonDocker.git
cd LemonDocker
```

#### **4. Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t lemonbooster -f Dockerfile .
```

This process may take several minutes, as it installs all the tools and dependencies.

#### **5. Run the Docker Container**

Start the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name lemonbooster lemonbooster
```

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8000:8000`: Maps port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on the host.
- `--name lemonbooster`: Names the container for easier management.

#### **6. Verify the Container is Running**

Check that the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output similar to:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND             CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
<CONTAINER_ID> lemonbooster   "/entrypoint.sh"    xx minutes ago   Up xx minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   lemonbooster
```

---

## Using the API

The API is available on port `8000` of your Droplet.

### Example Requests

#### **Run Nmap**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/run \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "tool": "nmap",
    "args": ["-sV", "scanme.nmap.org"]
}'
```

#### **Run Amass for Subdomain Enumeration**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/run \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "tool": "amass",
    "args": ["enum", "-d", "example.com"]
}'
```

#### **Run Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanning**

```bash
curl -X POST http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/run \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "tool": "nuclei",
    "args": ["-u", "https://example.com"]
}'
```

## Security Considerations

It is crucial to secure your API to prevent unauthorized access.

### Implementing Authentication

Modify the `api/server.py` file to include authentication using an API key.

**Step 1: Edit `server.py`**

```bash
nano api/server.py
```

**Add the following code at the beginning of the file:**

```python
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

**Modify the `run_tool()` function to include API key verification:**

```python
@app.route('/run', methods=['POST'])
def run_tool():
    api_key = request.headers.get('X-API-Key')
    if api_key != API_KEY:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Unauthorized'}), 401

    # Rest of the code...
```

**Step 2: Rebuild the Docker Image**

After modifying `server.py`, rebuild the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t lemonbooster -f Dockerfile .
```

**Step 3: Restart the Container**

Stop and remove the previous container:

```bash
docker stop lemonbooster
docker rm lemonbooster
```

Start a new container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name lemonbooster lemonbooster
```

**Step 4: Send Authenticated Requests**

Include the `X-API-Key` header in your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/run \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
-d '{
    "tool": "nuclei",
    "args": ["-u", "https://example.com"]
}'
```

### Configuring the Firewall

Use `ufw` to restrict access to port 8000:

```bash
# Install ufw if not already installed
apt-get install -y ufw

# Allow SSH
ufw allow ssh

# Allow access to port 8000 only from your IP
ufw allow from <YOUR_IP> to any port 8000

# Enable ufw
ufw enable
```

Replace `<YOUR_IP>` with the IP address from which you will access the API.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Tool Updates**: To update the tools within the container, update the `Dockerfile` and rebuild the image.
- **Limitations**: Ensure you have the appropriate permission before scanning domains or systems that you do not own.
- **Security**: Never expose the API without authentication in production environments.

### Appendix: build.sh Script

The `build.sh` script is located in the `install` directory of the repository. It automates the installation process.

#### build.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update system and install dependencies
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Install Git
apt-get install -y git

# Install Docker
apt-get install -y docker.io

# Start and enable Docker
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# Navigate to the repository root
cd ..

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t lemonbooster -f Dockerfile .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name lemonbooster lemonbooster

echo "LemonBooster is now running on port 8000."
```

**Notes:**

- The `build.sh` script assumes that you are in the `install` directory, and the `Dockerfile` is in the parent directory.
- It updates the system, installs Git and Docker, builds the Docker image, and runs the container.

**Usage:**

1. **SSH into the Droplet**

   ```bash
   ssh root@<DROPLET_IP>
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bonino97/LemonDocker.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Install Directory**

   ```bash
   cd LemonDocker/install
   ```

4. **Give Execution Permissions to build.sh**

   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ```

5. **Run build.sh**

   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

   This will set up everything automatically, leaving the Docker container running.

### Maintaining the Manual Installation Instructions

For users who prefer to install everything manually, the detailed manual installation steps are provided above in the [Manual Installation](#manual-installation) section.

---

**Important Notes:**

- Ensure that the `build.sh` script is placed inside the `install` directory of your repository.
- The `entrypoint.sh` and `api/server.py` files should be correctly placed in the repository as per the Dockerfile instructions.
- The `Dockerfile` should be present in the root of the repository.

**Entry point script (`entrypoint.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start the Flask API server
python3 /opt/api/server.py
```

This file should be in the root directory of your repository.

**API server (`api/server.py`):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/run', methods=['POST'])
def run_tool():
    data = request.get_json()
    tool = data.get('tool')
    args = data.get('args', [])

    if not tool:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No tool specified'}), 400

    try:
        command = [tool] + args
        result = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        return jsonify({
            'stdout': result.stdout,
            'stderr': result.stderr,
            'returncode': result.returncode
        })
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8000)
```

This file should be located in the `api` directory within your repository.
